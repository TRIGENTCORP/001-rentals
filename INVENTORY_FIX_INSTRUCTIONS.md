# 🔧 Power Bank Inventory Reduction Fix

## Problem
The power bank inventory count was not reducing when an admin confirms a rental payment. This was causing incorrect inventory counts and potential overbooking issues.

## Root Cause
The inventory reduction logic was failing due to:
1. **Database permissions issues** - RLS policies might be blocking updates
2. **Missing inventory records** - Some station/power bank type combinations might not have inventory records
3. **Silent failures** - Errors were being caught but not properly handled

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Functions Created
Created two secure database functions that bypass RLS policies:

#### `reduce_station_inventory(station_id, power_bank_type_id)`
- Reduces available inventory by 1 when a rental is confirmed
- Creates inventory record if it doesn't exist
- Returns detailed success/failure information

#### `increase_station_inventory(station_id, power_bank_type_id)`
- Increases available inventory by 1 when a rental is returned
- Ensures inventory doesn't exceed total_units
- Returns detailed success/failure information

### 2. Code Changes Made

#### AdminDashboard.tsx Updates:
- **Payment Confirmation**: Now uses `reduce_station_inventory()` function
- **Return Confirmation**: Now uses `increase_station_inventory()` function  
- **Force Return**: Now uses `increase_station_inventory()` function
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive debugging and error reporting
- **User Feedback**: Added toast notifications for inventory update results

### 3. Files Modified
- `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Updated inventory management logic
- `fix_inventory_reduction.sql` - Database functions (needs to be applied)

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Database Functions
Run the SQL file in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Execute the contents of fix_inventory_reduction.sql
-- This creates the reduce_station_inventory and increase_station_inventory functions
```

### Step 2: Test the Fix
1. **Create a booking** as a customer
2. **Confirm payment** as an admin
3. **Check inventory** - should reduce by 1
4. **Confirm return** as an admin  
5. **Check inventory** - should increase by 1

### Step 3: Verify Results
- Check browser console for detailed logging
- Verify toast notifications show success/failure
- Confirm inventory counts update correctly in the UI

## 🔍 Debugging Features Added

### Console Logging
- `🔍 Reducing inventory for station: [ID] power bank type: [ID]`
- `📊 Inventory update result: [JSON]`
- `✅ Inventory updated successfully: [message]`
- `⚠️ Inventory update failed: [message]`

### Toast Notifications
- **Success**: "Inventory updated successfully"
- **Warning**: "No available units to reduce"
- **Error**: "Failed to reduce inventory: [error details]"

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Detailed error messages
- Fallback mechanisms for missing records

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Database Functions
- Use `SECURITY DEFINER` to bypass RLS policies
- Proper parameter validation
- Atomic operations (all-or-nothing)
- Detailed return information

### Error Prevention
- Validates inventory exists before reducing
- Prevents negative inventory counts
- Handles missing records gracefully
- Ensures data consistency

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- ❌ Inventory count stays the same after payment confirmation
- ❌ Silent failures with no user feedback
- ❌ Potential overbooking issues

### After Fix
- ✅ Inventory count reduces by 1 when payment confirmed
- ✅ Inventory count increases by 1 when rental returned
- ✅ Clear success/error feedback to admin
- ✅ Automatic creation of missing inventory records
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Inventory Still Not Updating
1. **Check Database Functions**: Ensure SQL was applied successfully
2. **Check Console Logs**: Look for error messages in browser console
3. **Check Toast Notifications**: Look for success/error messages
4. **Verify Permissions**: Ensure admin user has proper database access

### Common Issues
- **Function not found**: Database functions not applied
- **Permission denied**: User doesn't have execute permissions
- **Missing records**: Station/power bank type combination not in database
- **Type errors**: TypeScript compilation issues (fixed with `as any`)

## 📝 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Database functions applied successfully
- [ ] Payment confirmation reduces inventory
- [ ] Return confirmation increases inventory
- [ ] Force return increases inventory
- [ ] Toast notifications work correctly
- [ ] Console logging shows detailed information
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] UI updates reflect inventory changes

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The fix is successful when:
1. **Inventory reduces** when admin confirms payment
2. **Inventory increases** when admin confirms return
3. **Clear feedback** is provided to admin users
4. **No silent failures** occur
5. **Data consistency** is maintained
